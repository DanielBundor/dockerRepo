# dockerRepo

## As part of best practice, I have created a branch called dan-docker to have all files within my dockerRepo pushed on there; thus, using the main branch for production. 

## Furthermore, as I continue to practice, I will develop new ideas and scalable solutions on how to improve my work.

## Thanks for stoping by.
